/*
Define a regular expression which tests if a given string representing a binary number is divisible by 5.
Examples:

// 5 is divisible by 5
preg_match($pattern, '101'); // => 1
// 135 is divisible by 5
preg_match($pattern, '10000111'); // => 1
// 666 is not divisible by 5
preg_match($pattern, '0000001010011010'); // => 0

Note:

This can be solved by creating a Finite State Machine that evaluates if a string representing a number in binary base is divisible by given number.
