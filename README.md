# Codewars
Codewars is a platform that helps you learn, train, and improve your coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels. You choose how you would like to learn. Do you want to take on increasingly difficult challenges? Maybe you prefer training through repetition and by improving your solutions. After solving a task, compare your answer with other users and learn from them or help less experienced users by answering their questions.

By following this tutorial, you will learn how to create a new account on Codewars, configure it for an optimal training experience, and become familiar with basic elements of the user interface. Soon you will be able to face the challenges collected in Codewars' library and start learning!

## Why a github repository ?
Using a GitHub repository for my CodeWars exercises is a great idea. It's like having a secundary portfolio for my coding journey. I can organize all my solutions neatly, get feedback from others, and show off my problem-solving skills. Sharing my work publicly not only showcases what I can do but also invites collaboration and demonstrates my commitment to learning and improving. It's a smart move that can help boost my profile in the tech community and open up new opportunities.
